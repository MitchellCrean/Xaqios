## Session 1

- The party (minus Tarlo) meets in a waiting room outside the council
- Feinren notices Gilberts book which makes his head hurt when he stares at it
- In the council room we meet Tarlo and several members of the council:
	- Zora 
	- Adrik 
	- Rowan Greycastle
- As we leave Rowan seems to have a headache (winces)
- The council commissions us to deal with a goblin camp outside of Granth which has been attacking merchants
## Session 2

- In the encampment, after dealing with guards outside the entrance and an animated armour, we find:
	- a ring of mind shielding
	- gold
	- potions of healing
	- a dead noble (whos necklace Gilbert steals)
- Tarlo and Gilbert seem to have some disagreements
## Session 3

- We kill a hobgoblin and 2 goblins, who with their dying breath say "the string will get you, and you will be its puppet"
- We find notes which seem to be ordered military instructions, telling the goblins to weaken the towns economic state and what merchants to target
- Additionally the parts of the notes written in goblin mention the puppetless string, and the notes themselves seem to come from people with high titles
- Tarlo remembers being taught that since the great war there has never been an effective banding together of the heretic religions
- We find a jail where it seems many people were kept/tortured, and additionally find a wand of secrets
- We kill the rest of the guards and leave the encampment
## [[Session 4 - On the road again]]

- On the road Gilbert attunes to the ring of mind shielding, and meets its current inhabitant, Gabriel, who says he wrote the book Gilbert possesses, which Gilbert found as an apprentice
- Inside the waiting room, Feinren (using detect magic) notices all the eye symbols drawn around the room are imbued with divination magic, and that there is a rainbow of colours radiating from Gilberts book. Additionally he and Gilbert both draw an eye on pieces of paper, which both start to glow with divination magic
- We tell the council about what we found, but Rowan seems dismissive until we give him the notes, after which he grows concerned until Zora takes the notes from him
- We are given 1000gp for what we did, and offered another mission to find more about the puppetless string, we accept this despite Adrik getting annoyed about using us over his soldiers
- Feinren notices faint evocation and divination magic around Rowan whenever Zora glares at him
- Tarlo takes us to the Dealer's Store (which has no eye symbols), where Gilbert notices a coin with an endless edge and Rahkoriin notices a set of sickles, but the Dealer stops him from touching them
- Dealer notices that Gilbert is touched by the spiral, and remembers Gabriel, before giving Gilbert the ring for half price after he promises to keep annoying Gabriel
- The Dealer kills Feinren out of boredom, with Feinren briefly feeling himself pulled towards the End instead of the Eye in the afterlife, before bring a gnome and a goblin out, after Gilbert rolls two d6 for him (playing his game)
- The Dealer forces the goblin to talk, who says the puppetless string will lead them to salvation, that they have joined them and will kill us all. We learn they are organising goblin, hobgoblins and orcs to eliminate what we consider society.Â 
- After Gilbert rolls the dice again, the Dealer tells us we can find more information in a town to the east, named Grudo and mostly filled with heretics and unaligned
## [[Session 5 - Ambushes and Arenas]]

- Rahkoriin asks about the sickles, and, after drawing a card from the Dealer's deck, we are all taken to an arena in the Dealers domain/dimension (inky black)
- Rahkoriin kills a dryad the Dealer summons in single combat, and after reattaching the Dryads head, the Dealer sells the sickles to him for 50 gold
- The dealer advises Gilbert to annoy Gabriel by being himself, and sells Feinren a 50gp diamond. Additionally throughout this the Dealer seems to be trying to convert us to the End, through various comments about him offering help and his God being more powerful, with most of these comments directed at Tarlo
- Tarlo takes us to a tavern, where Gabriel asks Gilbert to help him fall asleep, to which Gilbert refuses
- In a store named Gnome Depot, we meet the gnome, Doublelock, that the Dealer brought out, and we buy several healers kits, while Gilbert buys some thieves tools from Doublelock in a room with no eye symbols
- When asked about health potions, we are told Doublelock sells them for 30gp, but gets them from the Dealer, where he pays a different kind of price, and says thats why he was at the Dealer store yesterday. Additionally he recommends Rahkoriin go to Vistra to get some more quality armour
- Gilbert buys a horse he names carrots, while the rest of the party buys a cart. On the road Feinren notices the eye he drew before is no longer imbued with magic, and he draws another one for later testing (which also doesnt glow)
- The party is ambushed on the road by two orcs and an orc war-chief. The party kill the two orcs and focus on the war chief

## [[Session 6 - Grudo]]

- With the help of a figure from the woods, we kill the orc war-chief and the figure reveals themself as a half elf named Krihh, and joins the party
- Looting the bodies, we find:
	-  A locket with photos of the two orcs, with the inscription revealing they are the sons of the war-chief
	- Notes on all of the party (minus Krihh), detailing our whereabouts, who we are, what our abilities are, what each of us would be most dangerous at, and portraits of all of us (again minus Krihh)
	- A note saying payment will come later for killing us, it seems likely that these notes came from someone high-ranking in Granth
	- Symbols of the hunt
- We see the dealer in the distance who slowly claps before disappearing, and Krihh agrees to travel with us as they were also heading to Grudo as they hadn't been there before. Krihh states they are a follower of the vast
- Gabriel had been communicating to Gilbert throughout the fight, egging him on to kill, and after the battle he mocks him about how little he has learnt about the book, and recommends testing it on the party
- We pass a veil that was hiding Grudo from view, and go up to the gates, whose guards ask us how we knew of the town and its location, which Gilbert manages to vaguely explain away
- Feinren and Tarlo have eye symbols confiscated by the guards, and we travel through the town which is filled with wide mix of races, until we reach a stable where we leave Carrots and the cart
- We enter a shop with a skull and crossbones, where we meet a goblin who follows the Corruption, who excitedly talks about potions before selling Krihh 3 glass jars and Gilbert two poisons, one which is slow working and one which looks like a potion of healing
- We find a tavern

## [[Session 7 - A heist in Grudo]]

- Gilbert has dream of when he encountered his book from when he was an apprentice working in a ruined library
- In the bottom floor of the tavern we find the Dealer, who after much discussion we hesitantly make a deal with to find out where we should go from here
- The Dealer, in return for an unspecified favour tells us to go to Gorr, a bugbear of the eye who is the only one who could and would tell us what we need to know
- Gorr tells us the puppetless string is a new figure the heretics are amassing under, and treating as a deity, giving order to the heretics after the accepted religions tried to destroy their heirachy/order
- Gorr tells us to go to the mansion of a powerful orc named Ahkon to steal the notes he would having communicating with heretic Island, which would be in his private study
- After scoping out the mansion, the party sneaks back at night, and after Gilbert charms one of the guards to get Ahkon out of his study, Gilbert casts invisibility on Feinren, who misty steps up to the study and steals the notes and escapes
- We steal several notes, including ones in the same handwriting as the ones doxxing us, with the level of detail showing that there is an informant within Granth's council. The notes have the following information:
	- information on the council, with higher levels of detail on Rowan and his activities/plans, with these notes being written in the same handwriting as those we found on the orcs sent to kill us
	- information on outpost locations for the heretics, their chain of command, what the puppetless string is as a ruler and the names of the 3 main cities on the Gishin mainland
- We leave Grudo just in time, with Tarlo collecting her eye symbol and Feinren leaving his
- After passing the notes to her,we learn by Tarlo recognising the handwriting, that these notes were written by Zoral, furthermore Feinren reveals that Zora seems to be using some sort of magic on Rowan, mixture of divination and evocation
