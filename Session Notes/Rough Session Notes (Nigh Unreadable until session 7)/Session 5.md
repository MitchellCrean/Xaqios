Dealer's store ------------------------- 
Tom enquires about sickles (thought it was scythe before?). Dealer will sell sickles for 50 gold if tom proves himself worthy, brings out cards - sickles can expand and shrink if user is skilled - interested that tom is 'man of blood' - pick a card 4 of clubs 'hold them properly' black tentacles shoot across floor, we are all in black void area kind of grandstand 30ft - radius arena 

dealer pulls monster out of void is a tall, medium sized dryad - fey - dryad is being made to fight? - dryad is sorry feinren notes he can still summon familiar from pocket dimension while in the inky dimension dealer - tarlo 'how strong do you think your god is' 'stronger than yours' 'perhaps, but I could be more helpful' roots sprout from dryad, entangling tom tom kills the dryad black tendrils put the head back on the dryad, mends it and heals/revives dryad
