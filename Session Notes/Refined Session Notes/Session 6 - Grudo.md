—---- On the road---------- 

A figure darts out of the surrounding woods, throwing off their cloak to reveal a medium height half elf, with long flowing blonde hair, and bright blue eyes, wielding hand axes. This unknown figure assists the party in taking down the war-chief, taking the brunt of the Orcs attacks until Tarlo deals the killing blow.

As Gilbert calms carrots, the figure introduces themself as Krihh, stating that they came to assist us when they saw we were being attacked. When the rest of the party explains they were travelling to [[Grudo]], Krihh explains that they were also travelling to Grudo, as they had never been before, and mentions that they are a follower of the vast. 

We loot the corpses and find several items on the orcs, including 300 gold, a golden locket on the war-chief depicting the two other orcs with the inscription ‘my dear sons’ and several pages of notes on the party, excluding Krihh. These notes detail our location ever since we were sent to deal with the goblin camp, and include rough sketches of all of us and information on our powers and abilities, and which of us would be the most dangerous in which scenarios. At the end of the pages there is a note saying ‘payment will come later’, and it seems likely that the notes/orders came from a high ranking person in [[Granth]]. Additionally we notice that all the orcs are wearing symbols of the hunt, with how blatantly they are wearing them being somewhat uncommon. 

As we are discussing these notes, we see the dealer in the distance, slowly clapping before he disappears, additionally Gilbert remembers how [[Gabriel]] has been chiming in throughout the fight with the orcs, mostly saying to kill them and just being annoying. 

As the party is discussing Granth, Feinren asks Tarlo about the eye symbols plastered around the city, who says they are a form of worship, and doubles down on this being worship when asked about the divination imbued into them. 

Krihh asks the party why they are travelling to Granth, which Tarlo responds saying these people have been paid to assist me on my quest to purge the heretics, and tells Krihh that the eye would appreciate their help.

Gabriel mocks Gilbert about how little he has learned despite his history and holding onto the book for so long, recommends testing it on the rest of the party.

—---- Grudot —------------

Hours later, as the party travels down the road, we suddenly become aware that we are in Granth, with a veil disappearing that was previously obscuring the town. Two guards,a human and an orc, man the front gate of Grudot, who stop us until Gilbert explains vaguely why we are here, and how we knew of the town and its location, ‘pointed in the direction by an acquaintance’. The guards let us through, raising the portcullis and revealing a street bustling with a large variety of races, with orcs, dragonborn, goliaths and tieflings (but 0 goats). As cries of theft echo from various places, the Guards stop Feinren and Tarlo and order them to surrender their symbols of the eye, which Feinren does without complaint while Tarlo tries unsuccessfully to keep it. We arrive at a stable to store carrots and the cart, with Tarlo and Krihh realising they've been pickpocketed and lost a few items as they leave the cart. Looking at the surrounding street we see a variety of shops, with blacksmiths, general stores, pubs and some odd places with skull and cross bone signs, one of which we enter.

—---- Skull and crossbones —------

As we enter we see some walls lined with shelving, storing various bottles of liquid, some with skull and bones and others with symbols like poison or frost. Our attention is drawn to a goblin working in the corner with test tubes, wearing protective clothing and goggles as he works, carefully dripping a potion onto a piece of fabric, which it quickly dissolves. Furthermore, we notice him wearing a symbol relating to a religion known as the [[Corruption]], associated with slow decay and bugs. When asked he says it should take about a day and 30gp if we want potions of healing, before excitedly rambling about different potions he’d been making, such as a fire one which had burnt most of his hair when he’d made it. He happily says he can make anything we want, but we might have to get the ingredients, before quickly becoming dejected when Krihh asks for glass jars, which he sells Krihh 3 of, for 2gp each. Gilbert aks him about poisons, looking for a very fast, and a very slow acting potion, and the goblin excitedly talks to him, discussing a poison which looks like a potion of healing, a poison which takes more time, and a fun potion of fire breathing. Gilbert buys the slow poison and the one that looks like a health potion
