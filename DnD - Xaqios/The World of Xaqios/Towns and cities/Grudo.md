### Description
Grudo is the town east of Granth we were advised to go to by the dealer to find more information on the puppetless string. The town itself is hidden by some magical veil which obscures it from view, and its name and location seem to be kept hidden to some level
### Predominant Religions
Grudo, unlike the majority of towns on the main continent, has a large population of 'those who follow the "heretical" and unaligned religions
### Demographic
Grudo seems to have a wide spread of races, with a higher population of orcs, goblins, tieflings and dragonborn than most other places
### Important NPCs
##### Allied
- Gorr - Gorr may not be fully allied with us, but he is someone who we may be able to count on for help
##### Neutral
##### Enemy
- Ahkon - Very likely to be hostile to us if he finds out that we stole his notes, which seems likely given his contact with Zora
### Important Locations
##### NPC residences
- Gorrs house, located in the west side of the city
- Ahkons mansion, 3 store mansion with 8ft high walls, and highly protected grounds, likely even more so after our latest visit
##### Stores
- Skull and crossbones shop where we met the enthusiastic potion seller
### Crime/Guards
- The city is relatively guarded, with two guards outside a front entrance which can be sealed off with a portcullis
-  Crime seems relatively common in Grudo, with at least theft being a very common occurrence
### Attitude towards us
Currently unknown, but given our hasty exit and Ahkons influence in the town, could be hostile to us if we were to return
