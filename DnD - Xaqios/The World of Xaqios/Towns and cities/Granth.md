## Description
A relatively important city, and where we began our adventure
## Predominant Religions
Granth is mainly made of allied and unaligned religions, with the Eye having a heavy influence over the city, as symbols of the Eye can be found in almost all rooms
## Demographic
Unknown, but is slightly discriminatory to some races like Dragonborn
## Important NPCs
#### Allied
- [[Doublelock]] - he's just friendly
#### Neutral
- [[Dealer]] - May have some of our interests in heart, but not fully trustworthy in all regards I believe
- [[Adrik]] - Doesnt have the best opinion of us, but no reason to be hostile
- [[Arlo]] - idk hes a guard
- [[Rowan]] Greycastle - can assume he would be an ally, but it seems likely he is under some enchantment of Zora's
#### Enemy
-  [[Zora]] - not openly hostile to us yet, as we havent revealed she is a traitor, but can safely assume she will openly try to kill us if we reveal this
## Important Locations
##### Town buildings 
- Council room - its in the name
#### NPC residences
#### Stores
- Dealers store - may also be where he lives, filled with numerous objects of various religions and devoid of eye symbols
- Gnome Depot - the store of the lovely Doublelock
## Crime/Guards
Seemingly low crime, unknown what level of guards are present
## Attitude towards us
Neutral/allied
