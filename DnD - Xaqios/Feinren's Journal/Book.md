- the hunt was originally with the ginshin (not particularly strongly aligned), the end and the spiral were both aligned witht he brugado, they seemed to be the more powerful, the starters of the brugado, and the dark was completely unaligned, would assassinate for the highest player or who was aligned with particular interests at the time
- interesting things
	- seems lot of the unaligned religions were founders of what is now considered the accepted religions, they were the more powerful religons before and during large sections of the war
	- written by those who were unaligned
	- references betrayal done to the unaligned religions
	- betrayal was centered around them harvesting the power of the unaligned religions



- interesting, from what happened in the chamber and what Gilbert book says, it would be logical to conclude that the power harvested was put into the crystals, would explain why Rahkoriin didnt get a power up and seems to imply that the Puppetless string shouldnt benefit from us destroying crystals
