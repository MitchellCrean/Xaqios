 — Gilberts Dream —--------------
 
Taken back to an old memory, one he has tried to suppress for a long time

Sitting in the ruins of an ancient towering library, resting, bored – a colleague high elf comes  over - get to work - follow me 

Part of library collapsed with tree roots

Takes gilbert into backrooms, books lying everywhere - organise all the books, catalogue, and find someone else when you’re done - alphabetical, and size - 

Starts organising books, picks up odd book from high tower, section of library he is in at the moment has lot of religious texts

Goes to put it on pile

Idiot put smallest book on bottom of tile - tower collapses - book he placed on top lands directly infront of him and flips open - the book wrecks his mind - 8 damage (in the dream) - body shakes violently - writing which it looks like he recognises (but more you look at it you cant understand) - the book becomes more - and feels drawn to the book - wakes up

— Tavern —----------

Gilbert wakes up in a panic - gabriel starts laughing - what kind of dream were you having 

We all buy waffles/pancakes 

Good pancakes

Huon and I notice figure in back corner, feet kicked up, holding a drink, its the fucking dealer

I was interested to see if you could make it, i can feel when people are close to death, and it was interesting to see how close some of you were to death

Have you figured out who to talk to yet - would you like a hint

Looks directly at tarlo - you’re gonna want to hear this - noticed huon - you give lotta info for someone who want to be hidden - you like to assume things about me to you H - i never assume D

Looks at tarlo - wheres you’re eye, grinning - one day dealer, ill figure out how to do something very bad to you (fails to intimidate) - dealer laughs - seems like you all need some information - relates to having stuff stolen - automatically refills his drink

Well, i can tell you who to talk to, but i want you to remember that i did you all a favour, more so remember it was me and not your god who gave you this (looks at me and tarlo) - 

Note, for me and tarlo, once per short rest we get natural advantage on intelligence check

The deal connects to life and death and furthermore my god, i have no reason to lie - a small favour would be to buy me something or talk to someone for me - find me a piece of information, nothing too big, nothing too dangerous

Seems to be truthful, at least in his mind, enjoying that he can give you this info and our god eye cant

We take the deal - now is that one part of your group, the deal (krihh) - krihh accepts - thin green lines fly between all of us, then disappear - now there is someone you need to seek out, i can tell you their name, and bring you to them - up to you to convince them - if theres anyone sympathetic to your cause, it would be them - there is a bugbear who goes by the name Gore, he is of the eye (neat), and decided to throw his lot in with you for some reason - he is not on particularly anyones side, if anyone could, or would tll you what you need to know, it would be him. A bubble comes up, and shows his home from birds eye view of the west side of the city, the more middle class area, do you think you can find this on your own - try not to talk too much about bugbears when you speak to him, hes a tad touchy (bugbear of the eye, very unusual)

Dealer - i shall be seeing you all soon - transforms into skeletal shape, black pulsing beins form aorund him, and he disappear

—-- On the road again —-------

Rahkoriin gets pickpocketed

 Make it to the house

—- bug bear house —-----------

Nice house, marbly stone walls, dark wood single door, quite big, we knock

Who the hell is that - travellers from granth seeking information, pointed your direction by an acquaintance

We are were contracted by the council of granth, on our most recent expedition we came across notes that detailed an entity called the puppetless string

Gilbert shows him the notes doxxing us 

Someone is definitely trying to kill you 

I do know one or two things about the puppetless string, what would you want to know - we know nothing - what do you know of the history of the heretical religions - thousands of years ago, there was the great war between the gishin and the brudagot, as well as dieties and followers who didnt pick a side, or were too weak part of the brudagot to consolidate after the war, like the dark, becoming the unaligned. The Gishin were pushed out to the edge of the continent, onto another island where they are essentially stuck, there are no real heretics on the main continent. A place like grudot shouldnt really exist, which is why it has no symbols of the eye and the veil obscuring it. One of the main things the brudagot did to the gishin when they won the war is to remove every sense of order and hierarchy, lost control over this once they pushed them to the new island. Thats the history we know. Gore is happy feinren knows this (when im talking about history gabriel pipes in, thats not true, thats fuckings bullshit, thats actually kinda true, propaganda) (gabriel has lived through this period)

Gilbert asks what side he was on in the war (nat 1) (uses inspiration to get 15) Gabriel - im important, fuck you - i was a great, great mage of the spiral, warlock, paladin, i did it all, i played both sides, i would of won…., Im trapped in this ring for a reason. 

Gore is concerned about Gilbert talking to his hand (ring be invisible)

What I do know, is that they didnt do as well as they thought in eliminating structure, something knew came in, what they call the puppetless string, not sure if this is a new deity or figure, but have united heretics on the island and they are treating it as its deity. Gi how should we succeed - to be clear, you never talked to me - gi we were never here (uses invisibility) - that would be quite helpful for what i would not suggest you do, I would certainly not suggest you find the mansion of a very powerful orc, his name is Akhon - he is very powerful, he is both very very powerful religious figure, incredibly powerful magic and he is within the city - i certainly wouldnt suggest you break into the mansion that happens to be the biggest one in town with symbols of his family crest, and certainly not suggest you sneak into his private study, were there definitely wouldnt be records of his dealings and communication with the mainland, the mainland being my homeland, the island of Gishin. Now he has lots of guards, they go in shifts, inbetween their shifts you can get about 5 minutes, but that isnt consistent, and within the town he is well respected, do not get caught. Whatever you do, do not fight him, you will not win, leave grudot as quickly as you can, if they find out, they will chase you. 

Feinren moon walks out the door(earning more respect), gilbert puts down cup and disappears

Tarlo, why are you so against the church - chuckles, oh little one (not an insult), the church has corrupted what would be the magesty of the eye, one doesnt need the church to get knowledge, to know all, it is part of the eye, but the eye is not wholly made of it. 

— Various Shops —--

Gilbert buys grappling hook and rope, Rahkoriin looks for better armour

— scoping--

Rahk, gilbert, feinren scoping - main entrance on street, 8ft walls, no other entrance, two goblins at front, four goblins at any one time on patrol, one per side, few hobgoblins milling about, trained professionals, 3 storys, quite large, towards back of house servant entrance, on the very top level, right corner of house is where the private study is, two child orcs playing in the rooms

— Heist —--

Gilbert charms goblin to get akhon to get him to come down, invisibles me, i climb of wall, run across and use misty step, climb up onto the balcony, rummage through desk, find a letter of same handwriting of notes with out info, detailing information on rowan and his plans, things his been making and doing, detailed notes on the council as a whole, main individual there are notes on is rowan, find letter concrete proof that somebody in the council is working with the heretics, feeding them insider info, information on one or two outpost locations, chain of command, and what the puppetless strings are as a ruler, 3 cities of the mainland, detailed on the map of isaac. Leave balcony, bolt to the wall, leave Grudot

— On the road —--------
Does tarlo recognise the handwriting, recognises it as zora’s handwriting. For a member of the eye you’re rather obtuse. I copy notes down.
