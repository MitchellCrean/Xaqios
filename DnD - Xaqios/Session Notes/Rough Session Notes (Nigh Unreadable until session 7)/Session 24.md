## escaping ###
- Running along corridor
- rahkoriin crashes out of the window, hits ground fine (7 dmg)
- feinren misty steps until he appears 10 ft above ground and falls down (1 dmg)
- miko conjures two giant eagles, and jumps on one, tarlo jumps on the same one and gilbert jumps on the 2nd eagle, just as the guards from the room reach us
- gilbert eldritch blasts a guard as he leaves (neither hits), tarlo throws handaxe, and hits (6dmg)
- feinren - "fly you fools"
- four bowsmen shoot at miko, tarlo and gilbert just before they fly away, one arrow hits each, (g7 m6 t6)
- another two arrows hit gilbert, for total of 9 dmg
- 2 arrows hit feinren and rahkoriin each, for 8 and 6 dmg respectively
- weve all made it to the carriage


### Travel
- everyone rushes in to the carriage, and miko sends eagles back to harass soldiers, hears screams as we head back to the castle
- soldiers are stressed by rahkoriin werewolf form
- as we open the bag hear crying and begging (clear he has been doing this since he was put in the bag)
- head jumps out of bag, feinren shoves his hand into krats mouth
- guards are all very confused and very on edge
- guards seem more worried about us hurting them, then us being a bad luck charm
- one of the more confident guards, 'not much room to tie him up, maybe leave him in there'
- through thaumatology, head shoving and hand shoving, pass krat up to the castle
- third time feinren shoves his hand in krat bites, dealing 1 dmg to feinren 
- tarlo makes very awkward small talk with the guards

### Castle
- arrive at castle, say goodbye to soldiers and exit carriage
- lieutenant is waiting for us, ' how'd it go'
- 'wheres krat', feinren points to the bag
- gilbert - in the bag
- can he breathe in there - sometimes
- after lieutenant complains - miko - you get him next time, can we see the king now?
- you can go to the king now
- butler escorts us to the king


### King 
- wait outside doors for a moment while butler announces our arrival, and then we are let in
- air out krat again, shove him back into the bag
- ushered into the room
- king looks happier, back to more relaxed, but not happy please king he was before :(
- where is krat. Tadaaa - gestures towards the bag
- king looks very pleased with that
- miko said mission was more successful than expected, no casualties
- Gilbert relays what we did, - bagged and tagged krat
- miko - we're really funny
- king - have they been rubbing off on you?
- bring krat out of bag of holding, feinren puts hand in krat's mouth but removes it after king asks him t
- Gilbert checks the notes in the bag of holding, all are fine
- rahkoriin gives bag of holding back to feinren
- krat falls to his knees

- you really thought you could betray the eye to reclaim your power
	- eye tattoos on kings head open and seem to shatter (sorta fractally)
	- krat screams in pain as a ring of eyes brands its way around his forehead, burning his long hair in the back
	- I will tear all the knowledge from your mind, and it will be mine
	- king waves hand to take kratt away, guards take him away and shove piece of cloth in his mouth
	- miko follows guards out of room
- k > youve all done a very good job, now i require your employ further, from here you will all go to the elves, you will be sent to the kingdom of Vasto, sent as my emissaries, it is your job to make the king aware that the Gando family is conspiring with these evil forces, and have him expunge the evil from his lands
- now for the matter of payment
	- mission successful was quite well done, mission before however, as a colossal failure, will not get the full rewards
	- each of you will get 1.2k in gold 
	- unless you have anything more to say, you may leave me now and i will plan our future trip
- t > i do have a note to leave you before we go, a note from someone in our town (persuasion 4)
- tarlo hands over doublelocks note
- feinren mentions past person in dungeon
- king - i will have my guards storm the premises, free the prisoners and kill or imprison the other guards
- king gestures for someone to come and collect the documents
- we all leave
- gilbert - please dont change my room again
- king gives menacing grin

#### Outside ####
- we are taken to our rooms, all seem exact same rooms, but all seem a little smaller, especially gilberts and tarlos (gilberts is 4 inches smaller on each side)
- after we relax in our rooms for a lil bit, a darkness descends in tarlos room\

- dealer appears in skeleton form in tarlos room
- d> i heard that youre going to vasto, when you get there, there is another dungeon that you are going to need to explore, and another crystal you are going to need to destroy for me
- t > anything different about this one
- d> should be similar, dont know exact details of dungeon, but shouldnt be too difficult for you
- t > how have you been since ive last seen you
- d > your mentor is causing problems for me in granth, for someone who resurrected him he doesnt seem to repay the favour
- t> whats he doing
- d> hes destroying the corruption in the town
- tarlo laughs
- d> not just the bad corruption, but the good corruption like bribes to, its not right
- t> ill write him a letter and ask him to hear you out, but im sure hes doing his best
- d> that is very much the issue, the real issue is that he wont take any bribes - rants a bit - the one good thing he has done is that he has rearranged how the church works, essentially just scholars in their rooms, dont care what goes outside, so less guards to deal with, but its so hard to control the government
- t > that must be very frustrating, how does that make you feel (17 roll)
- d > frustrated, i have lots of plans and thing are constantly in motion, i have so much knowledge, and he wont take the bribes
- t> hes a diff person to his predecessors, hes trying to restructure the church to focus in on knowledge, maybe this is an opportunity for you try new ways to collect knowledge
- d > you are suggesting that i help the very religion and people who desecrated me in the first place
- talk for bit more
- d > when i see next, you will be in the elven kingdom, and i will make sure you know where you need to go, i will go collect all the info i can, and you will destroy this crystal for us
- dealer collapses into black goop
- t > yknow what, hes grown on me

- gilbert reads book
- feinren casts leomunds tiny hut and casts leomunds tiny hut
- gilbert book
	- book begins talking about downfall of spiral warlocks, gabriels fall interests him the most
	- arent many detail, but says that a number of the religions performed a ritual to take his power, gabriel tried to stop them and he was massacred
	- gabriel refuses to comment more on the actual events, but does say that it was a fair fight and that he almost won
	- gabriel is the last warlock mentioned, as book only focuses up until the end of the great war
	- book refers to smaller pool of power for the spiral
- feinrens book
	- specificially the eye, the buried and the vast, (humans elves and dwarves especially), gathered together in order to perform a ritual that took the power of the unaligned religions, who at the time had a lot more power, and they turned that power into crystals (number of crystals, insinuation that there are several, more than 3)
	- other accepted religions such as the lonely werent explicitly part of it, but were just weak enough that they werent targeted by the three
- feinren thinks this is concerning with the dealer and gabriel "concerned about gabriel and gilbert since they were from this time period, and were of the religions which had their power stolen"
- tarlo writes note to akarda - basically implying that they both do whats best for granth


### Next morning
- taken to breakfast with usual set up
- sitting on table in our usual spot is big bag of gold
- feinren power walks over to his bag
- gilbert rushes past everyone
- gilbert counts gold, is one short
- butler points out singular gold coin on the edge of the room, that gilbert knocked away when scrambling to bag
- gilbert sees butler hit a singular coin off the top on one of the piles
