	- light comes into the area and gilbert finds himself in wooden room
	- feet rest on the floor the slightest mm above the ground
	- sees himself in the mirror, body twisting, bones reaching out of the body, flesh pulsing, hand growing into long claws
	- looks into eyes in mirror
	- wakes up, feels powerful
	- 'so those side affects, i assume theyll happen eventually, i guess i just saw a glimpse into the future'
	- gabriel - the power youve harnessed will change very aspect of you, mind body and soul, and it will show, make you more powerful, go look in the mirror
	- not quite same as dream, but skin is shifting and swirling in spiral shapes, hands look long and thing, not physically happening to him right now, but an affect in the mirror
- feinren learns suggestion and mind spike, finishes writing in journal
- rahkoriin thinks a bit about his transformation yesterday
- go to funeral

##### funeral
- funeral director offers viewing of body to tarlo, asks if she thinks anyone else would join
- no its just me
- director walks out to backroom where body is, in the most beautiful coffin, beautiful design, red velvet interior
- akarda lays in coffin, military uniform, helmet lying next to head, bottom half of body covered
- everyone arrives, tarlo composes herself and walks out
- theres large amount of people, including rowan, adrik, doublelock, adventuring party on the left aisle, sitting right next to tarlos seat is the dealer, in young form in plain white shirt and black tie with a smirk on his face
- tarlo sits next to the dealer, who doesnt even look at tarlo for a while
- while the officiant is giving std funeral speal, the dealer talks to tarlo, you know this dealer doesnt have to happen, still doesnt
- i dont think thats what he would want, everyone has a time and it would dishonour his sacrifice
- do you want to know where he is right now?, death is not the end, puts finger on tarlos forehead
- tarlo sees what would be hell for a follower of the eye, feels incredible pain, hear agonising screams, see some of the most horrible tortures happening, eyes growing over their body, overlapping, before popping in spurts of blood
- thats where he is right now, same with zora
-  t - why is he there, why is it so awful there
- d - he must of commited a crime in the eye of, well the eye
- t - there was no one more loyal to the eye than him
- d - but the eye doesnt care about loyalty, it cares about knowledge, and he didnt spend his life gathering knowledge
- but you could save him, with my power
- accept my offer, become an avatar of me and you can use the power to bring him back
- t - lets talk after the funeral
- d - better before, heard to help someone when they are buried
- the officiant starts talking about praising the eye and how the eye would look after him, the eye cares for us all
- tarlo asks the dealer if he has a contract,  d- i dont do contracts, i do deals
- i offer you my power, with the expectation that you remember whos power you are borrowing, the power is yours to wield as you wish, but i expect you to do me a favour every now and then
- what if i cant fufill your favour, d - a broken deal never looks good
- tarlo shakes the dealers hand, and feels herself filled with this power, see black tendrils moving up her arm and soaking in to her skin, now has one level in warlock, now level 6
- dealer - would you like me to revive him now or after the funeral
- feinren hears little concerning parts of conversation, not full thing but feels that something big is about to happen, sees her shake his hand and the black tendrils, aware of deal. other people around like rahkoriin have also heard some parts of conversation but not as much
- two people walk up and carry the coffin away
- tarlo talks to rest of party in more secluded area - i have some interesting news, good news i hope, i have made a deal with the dealer and he will revive akarda
- fe - did you make sure he would bring akarda back as the way he was before
- d - what do you take me for, the intention of my word is as it is, full bill of health, with memories of hell, but the same
- d - he will come back a bit less crispy
- g - are you a follower of death now, t- i guess?, weakened connection with the eye from her feelings towards it and feeling connection to death now
- gabriel says people of the death fucking suck, they all stab you in the back, you try to stab them once and they kill you
- gi - care to elaborate, ga - none of your goddamn business right now
- dealer throws door open, they are at the cemetary, we should head off
- cold surrounds us all, black seeps under out feet throught the floorboards, erupting in a circle over us and transporting us to the cemetary
- cart and coffin are there, grave has been dug but not put in hole yet
- workers leave after tarlo asks them
- tarlo asks dealer to resurrect him, dealer swishes his hand and a blood curdling scream comes from the coffin, before theres banging on the coffin and the lid is moved off
- dealer melts away
- tarlo hugs akarda
- a - what happened, i dont know where i was, there where eyes everywhere, on me and they hurt
- asks what happened to zora, she dead, and you were too
- annoyed at rahkoriin for attacking
- akarda hugs tarlo, thank god youre alive
- looks at tarlo with concern after she explains deal with dealer, thank you, but you shouldnt of done that, though you saved me so i cant exactly get mad at you
- tarlo doesnt think they should trust the eye any more, they left you in so much pain,
- i think it was because i didnt follow the eye, i followed the church but just thought i followed the eye
- they are all going to be punished, unless i fix this, i have to become the new leader of the church, try and save at least a few of them
- rahkoriin talks about transformation, it was something from my past that i didnt think i still have with me
- walking through the streets, some people notice akarda and look at him with confusion
- we make it to a split section, one road goes to the barracks, one goes to the town hall/ where we are staying \
- tarlo asks akarda if he needs some time alone, maybe bit tired, cant really sleep when all your eyes are open
- we head back to town hall
- guards knock on our doors, and approach feinren, say that your presence is requested by rowan
- sit in council waiting room
- council door swings open and soldier tells us that rowan will see us now
- we all walk in
- rowan looks very healthy and well rested
- says im sorry for your loss, sorry i didnt get to talk to you after the funeral
- tarlo starts laughing, you dont have to worry about that now, akarda is alive again, good news
- hes alive, how, thats brilliant news
- we had a very helpful benefactor
- i think youll find that akarda will be very helpful in fixing some of the damage zora has done to the church
- rowan - i have recieved word from the capital, the king has requested your presence there, this hasnt been a truly isolated incident, there have been reported signs of spies and heretics, spits on ground (superstition of accepted religions that when you mention heretics you spit on ground, not too common, but similar to knocking on wood). The king is concerned about the widespread reach of this. Of the towns to be targeted we are the only ones who survived without any major damage or death. it is horrifying to think it took us so long to figure out what was happening 
- we have set up transport for you tomorrow to transport you to the capitol (Zarath)
- tomorrow at midday the carriage will leave from outside the townhall
- gilbert tries to buy lock picking sets from doublelock
- buy bag of holding
- tell him we are going to the capitol to see the king, thats incredible, you might see my cousin there, runs same shop as me, gnome depot, 
- when talking to tarlo, you didnt make a deal with the dealer did you?, tarlo, oh tarlo, that was dumb, you didnt sell him your soul did you
- doublelock writes note, hands it to us and ask us to give it to the king, hands it to tarlo, good luck
- we all head back to our rooms
