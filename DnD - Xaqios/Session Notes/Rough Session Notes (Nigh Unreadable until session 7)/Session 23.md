notes for myself this session - king did tell us previously that the most important part of our mission at the ball, did also tell us not to get caught, but that if e did to make sure it was in the pursuit of the information that would help him lock the maati family away

bribed librarian with 30gp for access to the restricted section, but cover of book was plain, shouldnt give away that it was in the restricted section

- my name is mico amastasia (not how its spelt but how it sounds), wood elf druid (on slightly shorter side for an elf), standing on the corner of the room and doesnt seem like she is from here
- the king lounges angrily with menacing intent
- if being caught was not acceptable, why did you make it seem so by saying if we were caught to make sure in doing so that we found the necessary information
- angry at tarlo for making deal with guards 
- guards will have to be imprisoned or executed
- tarlo suggests moving guards to granth
- after good persuasion manages to convince the king to not execute them and that granth would be a good idea
- security of our land is more important then any set of individuals
- please explain what went so wrong

- Tarlo:
  - was investigating, heard noises so hid away, heard murder being commited because one individual wasnt comfortable with complying with the maati families plans, which he was murdered for.
  - After i heard the murder leave i entered the room and got all the evidence i have since handed to you, and was then caught when i attempted to leave
- Gilbert:
  - was invisible, stalking through grounds
  - minor slip up ended up with me being knocked  out, woke up tied up with tarlo
  - King, where were you searching -  g> in the cellars/dungeons -  k> any imporant info - g> explains some of the the info he found downstairs

- as unsatisfactory as this mission has been, i need another
- king - tonight break into the maati family, search the cellars and apprehend the head of the maati family, dont make a scene
- under no circumstances kill him
- when searching the cellars, do so discretely, when arresting do as you please
- given the unsatisfactory nature of your last mission, ive bought in a baby sitter, miko
-  feinren gives king the ring he picked up, king confirms it is the insignia of the assassins of the dark
- feinren says its chance its he grandpa as he got a death threart
- king - why?!
- f - been a while since hed seen me
- k - leave my sight

- as the five of us set out into the hall
- miko and party introduces themselves
- gilbert leads way to medic instead of butler - leaves butler confused
- medic casts healing spell on all of us
- all healed by 25, and then he goes and gives us all potion of healing
- do short rest
- fein - "one cannot question his majesties infalliable logic" - king 'knows this', feels better (hears the words but not the sarcasm) 
- discuss plans
- lieutenant comes up to us - king has informed me of your mission, you will leave as soon as possible, we have prepared carriage (with guards if you get attacked)
- 6 soldiers are in the carriage with us, in bigger carriage than usual (soldiers all look scared)
- gil - come here often, soldier looks up at gil, accidentally looks in his eyes and then looks back down
- ta - you alright
- sold - yeah, just not exactly mission we signed up for 
- many soldiers look nervous, some look sick, we have bad track record for being attacked and they dont think they can deal with what were being attacked as

- carriage pulls up near the grounds of the maati family
- we dont believe at the moment the grounds are being guarded, but the the castle, 
- feinren scouts around castle with larry
- around the castle there are three main entrances and a smaller staff entrance
- four guards on the main entrance, two on another (left side), two on the back entrance, and no guards on the staff entrance. See few guards walking through all the levels though the windows
- two guard generally looking around whole area
- everyone except gilbert has invisibilty cast on them by feinren and gilbert (fe, gil), (ta, mi)
- roll acrobatics, everyone except miko and rahkoriin succeed (bar was 4, two nat 1s damn)
- everyone eventually gets over and we circle around to the servants entrance
- miko casts pass without trace
- got through servant entrance and follow steps down to a door
- gil uses medallion of thoughts and detects the thoughts of someone behind the door
- sees images and things flowing through creatures head (very dreamlike, so creature is dreaming)
- open the door and step into a hallway, take a left
- as walk along hear some mutterings of conversation and armour (moving away), and some muttering that seems to be from a room a bit further away
- sees that hallway appears to follow down to the main entrance
- find ourselves in corridors heading back in the ballroom, gilbert uses detect thoughts and finds nothing
- find ourselves at entrance of ballroom, hear some voices, but coming from where staff were exiting and entering from before during the event
- follow gilbert to hall leading to bathroom and dungeon, come to t intersection of stairs, hear voices on our left
- feinren peaks head around corner and sees 4 guards approaching from the left, tells gilbert, who goes to bathroom to hide, hides in a corner, rahkoriin follows for whatever reason?
- tarlo, miko and feinren presses themselves against wall to hide
- guards pass us and continue down to the right side of the t intersection
- walks past first floor and pantry, come to door gilbert found before hand, open it and go down to the cellar/dungeon - dark and musty, stone, and lining the walls are cells
- feinren sees if he can recognise any of the prisoners, recognises one of them as a member of a lower bearing family who i recognise as a kid from gatherings
- walk past the cells, and go down to the records room
- gilbert looks through records, people have been brought in for information, ransoming, feinren sees the guy who he recognised records, he was kidnapped as leverage so lower family would be on maatis side for voting purpose
- some records are in goblin and orc, records written by  people of the flesh and signed off, records are very disturbing, almost medical in nature, religious experiments in how far they can push their powers
- other records are some deals that have been made, such as financial documents and other details
- some of records talk about experiments that have been requested by the Gando family (elvish family mentioned before)
- feinren goes to one of the other doors as listens to it, hears someone snoring from behind
- miko uses conjure animals to summon 8 scorpions who scuttle underneath the door
- scorpions come back, and tell miko that inside the room is a medium sized human in armour, with some weapons on the bedside table, and inside the room is a chest, looks like someones living quarters
- feinren casts sleep, everyone moves inside and wakes creature up, seems to be an orc
- gilbert charms the orc as it wakes up, tells it to go back to sleep (nat 20) which it does
- gilbert takes coin purse, and important records, and rahkoriin puts longsword in bag of holding
- gilbert opens chest, full of clothes and armour
- rahkoriin takes the armour

- miko uses locate object to find krats crystal eye (and hence him)
- senses direction is very much vertically up, and a lil to the right
- rahkoriin does perception check as we get back up to the ground floor, hears voices that seem to have passed us, hears no voices in the stair well
- continue up the stairs until locate object levels out
- feinren hears voices in some rooms and studies, and some voices in the distance of the hallway on the right, relays this info
- heads down to the left, following pull of locate object
- keep following pull, until feel that object is quite close on the right of us, door ahead of us appears that it would connect to the relevant room
- rahkoriin presses ear to door, hears krat speaking on the other side, and two other voices talking with him, with shuffle of armour on other side of the room
- gilbert examines door, sees door hinges on this side
- gilbert and feinren cast minor illusion to make it look like door stays closed, and gilbert oils the door and opens it 
- all invisibles walk into the room, see 3 people, krat sitting behind the desk, and two people infront of him that we recognise from the ball, in the room there are 5 armoured guards, krat and two people having argument, krat giving demands
- krat is talking to the two others about 'bringing them in early'
- leave to have quiet discussion among party

- fuck ton of planning shenanigans
- rahkoriin hybrid transformation
