- when looking at gilbert, his skin shifts and shimmers in a way, getting funky
##### Dealer Store
As we leave the dealers store, we each feel a health potion appear in our back pocket
- noted wrapped around saying good luck
##### Granth
- hear clatter of armour mid-distance away, hear guards rushing away (that we previously scared)
- leave as guards are milling around
- move around outskirts of town 
##### Zoras mansion
modern greek esq mansion, pillars and such
- see guards milling around house
- see akarda going up to front door and being let in
- sneak around to back entrance
- find entrance, natural cave entrance with basic metal bars and gate in the center 
- Gilbert walks up to guard, coughs, guard scrambles for his weapon, Gilbert intimidates guard, flourishing his armour, gu: "Jeff?", and ive been looking for a pair of boots, Gilbert waves everyone through
- We enter the door
##### Cave system
- run into two guards, burn them with burnings hands, one of them enters rage by smoking
- kill both guards
- keep moving through cave system
- enter open part of cave, with tables and a chest or two
- I use wand of secrets, it does nothing
- in the opening out of the chamber there are two paths, one leading to the left and one to the right
- find general supplies, cigarettes and bottles of alcohol in the chest/around the place
- go down the left path, bit more lighting down this path
- walk for about 10 minutes without running into anything, path then opens up into a chamber
- in the chamber we see two great big almost eyeball, spectators, cyclops face with single eye, four eye coming out of body, each with eye on the end
- know from history check that they guard things, are powerful and that they can be talked to, but are not particularly intelligent
- convince spectators we are repairmen/contractors, they get confused after i say Zora is a friend, offering her a friend discount, offer him friend discount, he seems to be excited. Spectators have forgotten about Gilberts armour magically appearing and disappearing
- spectators want to help us so we can have picnic after job done, want job to get done as soon as possible.
- Tarlo asks them names, they are Zoraq (zor-ack) and Lormar (lore-marr), new friends!
- We go past them into the door, they asks us to be quick, use eye arm to whisper be quiet, holding eye arm as you would sort of cupped hand 

- enter Zoras chamber, see Zora, semicircle of 5 guards, 2 spectators, 2 guards holding akarada, and of course, akarda
- semi-circle of 15ft diameter
