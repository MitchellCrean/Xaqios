-- On the road again ----------------------------------------------

we asks tarlo to put eye away while discussing plans of what to do
feinren stuffs note down boot

-------------- in granth ------------------------

enter the city
 put carrots away

notice a higher presence of guards, these seem to be  paladin religious type, all of the eye
chain armour, all chain is individual eye linking together, pattern of green and black

guards seem to be looking for someone
tarlo recognises them as specific church guards, weird as they arent usually patrolling the streets

--------- to the dude that tarlo trusts ------------------------
we walk to the church heavy centre of town

Akarda (Ah card uh?) - tarlos mentor - tall variant human, slightly darker skin, same armour as evryone else, but slightly more intricately designed

we go into the church barracks
everyone turns to us and puts their hands on their weapons
Akarda bursts out of his office - Tarlo, Tarlo! youre here
ushers us into his office, everyone gives us dirty looks

Tarlo, what the fuck is going on, tells us Zora has given an order for all of us to be captured, surprised we got this far
A "What happened"
T explains what we did, (A hasnt heard of the puppetless strings)
A says Zora has been completely unhinged, and Rowan hasnt been doing anything
Gets annoyed at gilbert for interrupting, im trying to talk to my goddaughter here
T do you think Zora is in the right state to be leading right now
A im not questioning our leader, but the things she is doing arent making sense, hasnt explained why we are being secretly brought to a place he cant say

i hand A the notes, with the details on Tarlo and the commands for the hit on top
tell him about Zora controlling Rowan - he says we need to fix this

Need to separate Zora and Rowan, get Rowan from out from under her control

dont know how powerful Zora is, tells us Zora was asking us to be taken to dungeon/catacombs underneath Zora's mansion, no one knows whos under there)

laughs at us calling dealer an ally, Gabriel praises A? (this guy knows what hes talking about), also gabriels being constantly annoying

Talking to Adrik isnt a bad idea, but his position doesnt hold much in recent years

realises chance zora looking through armour 
A says hell pretend he is taking us to Zoras basement 
Walks us out of the barracks in shackles
I cast web so it looks like we escaped him and trapped him 

only church guard was told to look for us 

tom rolls nat 20, skyrim sneak walks away
we head to the dealers store

as we walk through the streets we see eyes everywhere, hear clamour of guards every now and then
i use detect magic ritual, both eyes in the notebook are glowing, the paladins armour shines like a beacon 
 we get to the dealers store

------------- in the dealers store --------------------

in the shop see huge array of glow from magical items, ends as I walk into the store

I do finger guns to the dealer, he does it back and I get 3 temp hit-points
'you know why we are here'
tell him about Zora stuff
'well i know now'

D - ive known Zora is a liar for a very long time, since ive met her

tell Dealer about Zora controlling Rowan,  'ive seen her do it before, didnt know she was doing to Rowan'

'i will give you some advice, Rowan is the absolute power in this town, if he says something that is law, i would advise breaking him out from under her control'

Show dealer the notes, he hands them back, says they will do as evidence

What you are going to want to do, is there a few ways to break someone out from her control, you can kill Zora and these notes will exonerate you, you can show Rowan the notes and try to break his mind free, but this will be harder

I know Zora has catacombs under her house, if she needs an escape, it would be there, and thats where she would be doing most of her operations, dont know if she would be harbouring any of the Gishin under there

G - you said these catacombs are large, are there any entrances to it not from her house you know of

D - yes, theres an entrance on the mountain where Zoras house is position, it is guarded. I dont know of any entrance which isnt 

D- our time is up, group of soldiers barge down stairwell, group of 4 

Gilbert says to dealer if you dont help us ima start using items from your shop, dealer puts us in his arena with the guards. Guards try to chant spell, doesnt work, fizzles out

you have two options, either you fail to capture us, or you fail to capture us and your family never sees you again - Gilbert 

Gu - we don't want to die, but we also dont know where we are and you are criminals of the church
Gilbert tells them to walk away (hopefully dealer will let them out)

2 guards walk out, disappear after walking for a bit

Gil - if you dont walk now, youve made your choice

guy i attacks tries running away, 
Gilbert fucking kills a guy, turns him into his breastplate, all the eyes becoming images of him kneeling and praying, Gabriel finally compliments Gilbert (good job kid)

Tarlo does not lethal damage, rolls nat 1 on medicene check, makes it much work (looks like shes torturing the body) (nevermind this didnt happen, used lucky)

Dealer compliments Gilbert for the masterful killing
