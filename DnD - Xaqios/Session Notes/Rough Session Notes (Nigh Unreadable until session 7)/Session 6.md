-- on the road ---------- 
huons character darts out of woods, cloak thrown off, reveals mid height person, slightly smaller than average, long flowing blond air, likely half elf, bright blue eyes, mostly indistinct/unnoticeable?, wielding handaxes, 
ava kills the orc war-chief 
gilbert calms carrots newcomer introduces themself as krihh (kre ah?), says they wanted to come in and help when they saw us being attacked, newcomer says they are familiar with grudot, was travelling to grudot themself, mentions they are follower of the vast 

looting the corpse
golden locket on warchief, has the other two orcs on the sides of the locket, 'my dear sons', also find papers that detail each of us, except krihh, detailed information, wearabouts over last couple of days since we were sent to kill group of goblins, our powers and abilties, which one of us are the most dangerous and in which way, rough sketches of all of us. 'the payment will come later', were hired to kill us for money. notice clip of the hunt on his body, wearing it blatantly which is something uncommon 

out of the corner of our eye we see the dealer standing in the distance, clapping, before disappearing throughout the encounter, gilbert finds that gabriel has been chiming in, 90% of the time just saying 'you should kill them'. just being annoying in general 
seems orcs were sent by high ranker in Granth 
when talking abouts symbols in granth, tarlo says the eyes around are form of worship, but the detection magic, exactly... worship krihh is travelling to grudot as they havent been before 
tarlos being racist againnnnnn tarlo - theyve been paid to assist me on my quest, to purge the heretics, to krihh, the eye would be very greatful for your help gabirel, youve had the book for such a long time and with such a history, and learned so little should test on your friends? --- 

GRUDOT ================ 
at somepoint we are suddenly aware we are in grudot, go from seeing nothing to seeing a large city, there was veil obscuring it.
Guards manning front gate of town, one human, other is an orc. Large mix of races here, more predominantly orcs and goblins than elves and humans. dm retcon - as we entered the city, made us surrender our eye, give us note ticket, we can pick it up later, tarlo is outraged 'this is bad customer service', orc rips it off tarlo, human guard laughs 

Guards - halt, what is your business here. Gilbert - work guards look at us funny, what kind of work freelance orc relaxes, human how do you know of grudot, only those who know its name and its location can find it. an aquaintance pointeed us in this direction for some work guards let us in portcullis raises and we enter the streets

cries of theft and thevery from different places, huge variety of races, dragonborn, tiefling, orcs, goliaths, but 0 goats :( huon and ava are missing some stuff, rolled low on perception 

find a stable to store carrots see general stores, blacksmiths, odd signed places with skull and bones, pubs, no gnome depot go into a skull and crossbones place 

---- skull and cross bones shop -----------

some walls lined with shelving, on shelving has bottles of liquid, some with skull and bones, some symbols for poison and frost in the left corner, see a funny little goblin working with test tubes, wearing big goggles and thick protective clothing, lil splashes and pops, drips potion on fabric, dissolves right through it and almost hits foot.

we recognise a symbol he is wearing on his necklace as the symbol relating to the religion that is known as corruption, who are known for creating poisons and being fans of bugs, interested in the slow decay of the world and thingies how long to make potion of healing, shouldnt taken too long, only a day, and cost about 30gp 

what poisons do you make - really interesting one with fire, which singed off some of his hair when he was making it can make anything you want me too, but will have to get him the ingredients. starts rambling gets sad/insulted when huon asks for glass jars huon buys 3 glass jars for 2gp each. gilbert, id like to buy a poison - gets really excited, gilbert asks for incredibly fast and slow working poisons - this ones really cool, you can trick people into thinking its a health potion - this one can take a lil bit of time, damages them every so often - now this ones fun, its really direct, not technically poison, its a potion of firebreathing - gilbert bought slow acting one and one that looks like a health potion
