portents for now:  5 and 11 
gilbert has attuned ----------------------------------------- 
gilbert conversation with ring the name is gabriel another one that book of yours, he wrote it --------------------------------------------------- 
gilbert told us this he was apprentice before, sorted through books, picked up the book - 

white glow around all eye symbols, one across from me has a stronger glow, including little pins - drawing eye on piece of paper also makes white glow - rainbow of colours around gilberts book, not defined by schools, radiating from the book 

rowan greycastle - might have migraine - zora - green and black robes, symbol of eye - glowing with white obviously - eye glow green through blindfold - not magic glow justr normal glow, with white glow - adrik - dwarf heavy iron glove, war axe - pissed at zora- -zora thanks tarlo for goblin crane, shoots dirty look at gilbert 
dealer - knows everything, isnt well liked we go to the dealer -rowan - zora looks sour/concerned at rowan -zora takes papers from rowan, rowan goes from conerned to relaxed -adrik thinks they dont need us, soldiers can handle it zora gets angry at adrik at time i see glowing light around rowan, sometimes white, sometimes red - evocation or weird mix when zora stares directly at rowan going to dealer, knows everything in granth, isnt well liked no eyes 

in the dealers store 

dealer is a skeleton, wrapped around bones are wrapped in veins of deep sluggish black, wisps coming off veins 

in store-------- 
block of clay molded in fractal smaller tokens - dollar with numbers that arent numbers - coin - edge keeps going scythe - chained sickle, increases range, very powerful, quite old 

dealer wants to play game with him - for half price ring - "haha what a coward" dealer almost smiles at mention of gabriel "ah what a prick" knew him when he was younger veins start pulsing harder eyes appear, eyes close, black tendrils flesh around him dealer is now young handsome 27 year old, thick black hair, black eyes, no pupils gabriels still in the ring "hiding from your fate are you" - gilbert promises to annoy gabriel every once in a while to get coin half price 

-- what do you know of the puppetles strings - i die vague feeling of souls pulled between two things, pulled towards death instead of eye - 

gilbert roll 8 in total - felt happy - gained temp hitpoints - dealer flicks hand, one goblin and one gnome are pulled from backroom (of store, no the backrooms) - asks goblin info, goblin refuses, dealer brings out dark chain, chokes goblin until he tells - puppetless strings will lead us to salvation, they have joined us and they will you all - organising goblin, hobgoblins and orcs, planning to eliminate what we consider society

 can find more info at outskirt town, but why would i tell you that -becuase the eye wants you to - tarlo - would a good enough reason be if i roll the dice again - gilbert rolls 4 (1-3) - gilbert on one hitpoint - bleeding out of pores - there is a village out to the east - called grudo (grew-dough) - made of ehat you (tarlo) would consider heretics and those you dont care about
