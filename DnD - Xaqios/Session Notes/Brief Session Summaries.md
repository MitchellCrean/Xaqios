## [[Session 4 - On the road again]]

- On the road Gilbert attunes to the ring of mind shielding, and meets its current inhabitant, Gabriel, who says he wrote the book Gilbert possesses, which Gilbert found as an apprentice
- Inside the waiting room, Feinren (using detect magic) notices all the eye symbols drawn around the room are imbued with divination magic, and that there is a rainbow of colours radiating from Gilberts book. Additionally he and Gilbert both draw an eye on pieces of paper, which both start to glow with divination magic
- We tell the council about what we found, but Rowan seems dismissive until we give him the notes, after which he grows concerned until Zora takes the notes from him

- Rahkoriin kills a dryad the Dealer summons in single combat, and after reattaching the Dryads head, the Dealer sells the sickles to him for 50 gold
- The dealer advises Gilbert to annoy Gabriel by being himself, and sells Feinren a 50gp diamond. Additionally throughout this the Dealer seems to be trying to convert us to the End, through various comments about him offering help and his God being more powerful, with most of these comments directed at Tarlo
- Tarlo takes us to a tavern, where Gabriel asks Gilbert to help him fall asleep, to which Gilbert refuses
- In a store named Gnome Depot, we meet the gnome, Doublelock, that the Dealer brought out, and we buy several healers kits, while Gilbert buys some thieves tools from Doublelock in a room with no eye symbols
- When asked about health potions, we are told Doublelock sells them for 30gp, but gets them from the Dealer, where he pays a different kind of price, and says thats why he was at the Dealer store yesterday. Additionally he recommends Rahkoriin go to Vistra to get some more quality armour
- Gilbert buys a horse he names carrots, while the rest of the party buys a cart. On the road Feinren notices the eye he drew before is no longer imbued with magic, and he draws another one for later testing (which also doesnt glow)

## [[Session 6 - Grudo]]

- Looting the bodies, we find:
	-  A locket with photos of the two orcs, with the inscription revealing they are the sons of the war-chief
	- Notes on all of the party (minus Krihh), detailing our whereabouts, who we are, what our abilities are, what each of us would be most dangerous at, and portraits of all of us (again minus Krihh)
	- A note saying payment will come later for killing us, it seems likely that these notes came from someone high-ranking in Granth
	- Symbols of the hunt
- We see the dealer in the distance who slowly claps before disappearing, and Krihh agrees to travel with us as they were also heading to Grudo as they hadn't been there before. Krihh states they are a follower of the vast
- Gabriel had been communicating to Gilbert throughout the fight, egging him on to kill, and after the battle he mocks him about how little he has learnt about the book, and recommends testing it on the party
- We pass a veil that was hiding Grudo from view, and go up to the gates, whose guards ask us how we knew of the town and its location, which Gilbert manages to vaguely explain away
- Feinren and Tarlo have eye symbols confiscated by the guards, and we travel through the town which is filled with wide mix of races, until we reach a stable where we leave Carrots and the cart
- We enter a shop with a skull and crossbones, where we meet a goblin who follows the Corruption, who excitedly talks about potions before selling Krihh 3 glass jars and Gilbert two poisons, one which is slow working and one which looks like a potion of healing
- We find a tavern

## [[Session 7 - A heist in Grudo]]

- Gilbert has dream of when he encountered his book from when he was an apprentice working in a ruined library
- In the bottom floor of the tavern we find the Dealer, who after much discussion we hesitantly make a deal with to find out where we should go from here
- The Dealer, in return for an unspecified favour tells us to go to Gorr, a bugbear of the eye who is the only one who could and would tell us what we need to know
- Gorr tells us the puppetless string is a new figure the heretics are amassing under, and treating as a deity, giving order to the heretics after the accepted religions tried to destroy their heirachy/order
- Gorr tells us to go to the mansion of a powerful orc named Ahkon to steal the notes he would having communicating with heretic Island, which would be in his private study
- After scoping out the mansion, the party sneaks back at night, and after Gilbert charms one of the guards to get Ahkon out of his study, Gilbert casts invisibility on Feinren, who misty steps up to the study and steals the notes and escapes
- We steal several notes, including ones in the same handwriting as the ones doxxing us, with the level of detail showing that there is an informant within Granth's council. The notes have the following information:
	- information on the council, with higher levels of detail on Rowan and his activities/plans, with these notes being written in the same handwriting as those we found on the orcs sent to kill us
	- information on outpost locations for the heretics, their chain of command, what the puppetless string is as a ruler and the names of the 3 main cities on the Gishin mainland
- We leave Grudo just in time, with Tarlo collecting her eye symbol and Feinren leaving his
- After passing the notes to her,we learn by Tarlo recognising the handwriting, that these notes were written by Zoral, furthermore Feinren reveals that Zora seems to be using some sort of magic on Rowan, mixture of divination and evocation


## [[Session 8 - Trouble in Granth]]

- Akarda asks us what we've done, and explains that Zora has ordered us to be captured and taken to the catacombs beneath her mansion
- We show Akarda the notes written by Zora and tell him that she is controlling Rowan
- Akarda says he will help us fix this, and takes us out of the barracks under the guise of us being his prisoners, once he takes us out of the church district, he frees us and tell us to attack him to make it look like there was a struggle, Feinren uses web to make it look like he was stuck and couldnt chase us
- We go to the dealer and explain the situation
- The dealer says he knew that Zora was a liar, and knew that she could control people, but didnt know that Zora was controlling Rowan
- The dealer tells us of a secret entrance to the catacombs beneath Zora's mansions on the mountain, and says that to break Zora's control over Rowan, we would either have to kill Zora or show Rowan the notes, but that the latter would be unlikely to work
- As he finishes saying this, four church guards rush down the stairs and, after Gilbert asks him to under threat of destroying his store, the dealer transports us into his arena
