##### —--- Travelling back from camp

Gilbert attunes to the ring of mind shielding, and after hearing painful laughter for a while, has a conversation with the ring's inhabitant, [[Gabriel]]. Gabriel is the writer of Gilbert’s book.

—---- In the waiting room ---------------

Gilbert explains how he came by the book, as he was an apprentice before, and picked up the book while sorting through others.

Through detect magic, Feinren notices a divination aura around all the eyes in the room, with a stronger aura from one in particular, as well as a confusing rainbow of colours emanating from Gilberts book. Both Gilbert and Feinren notice that drawing an eye symbol will give it a divination aura.

—----- In the council room —----------

Feinren notices divination aura around [[Zora]].

Tarlo gives Zora the goblin crane, which she thanks Tarlo for, but shoots a dirty look at Gilbert.

When talking about our findings of the puppetless string, [[Rowan]] (who seems to have a headache) initially dismisses it, and gets slightly frustrated, with Zora shooting a sour look at him, but when we hand him the papers he grows quiet and concerned. Zora takes the papers from him, causing him to relax. Rowan gives us 1000 gold for handling the camp, but offers more rewards if we investigate the puppetless string. [[Adrik]] grows annoyed from this, saying that they don't need us, and his soldiers can handle it, causing Zora to yell at him to shut up. Zora recommends we go to the dealer, saying Tarlo will guide us.

Throughout this, whenever Zora has directly stared at Rowan, Feinren has noticed a faint aura of divination and evocation around Rowan. (Feinren hasn't communicated this to the rest of the group yet)

—---- In the dealer’s store —----------

There are no eyes in the store, and the [[Dealer]] sits in the centre as a skeleton, bones wrapped in thick, black veins which give off wisps of black vapour. In the store there a several items different members find interesting, such as a clay fractal and a coin with an endless edge for Gilbert, and a scythe for Rahkoriin. When Rahkoriin touches the scythe, the dealer stops him, and asks him to put it back down, explaining the scythes features as an old, powerful chained sickle, which Rahkoriin wasn't quite ready for. 

The dealer notices Gilbert as touched by the fractal (maybe specifically the book), saying he has met many like him before. When Gilbert tries to buy the coin, and the dealer offers it for half price if he ‘plays a game’, Gilbert refuses, causing Gabriel to laugh and call him a coward. When Feinren asks if the dealer knew Gabriel, the dealer smiles “ah, what a prick”, and after stating he knew him when he was younger, transforms into a handsome 27 year old with thick black hair and eyes so black they have no pupils. The dealer is amused that Gabriel is still in the ring “hiding from his fate”. Gilbert buys the coin for half price after promising the dealer to annoy Gabriel every now and then.

When we ask the dealer what he knows of the puppetless string, he asks us to play his game. After a brief silence he waves his hand, instantly killing Feinren, who has a brief glimpse of the afterlife(feeling of soul being pulled towards death instead of Eye), before bringing him back. Gilbert rolls the dice, getting 8 in total which causes him to gain temp hitpoints and feel happy. The dealer is satisfied, and waves his hand, pulling a goblin and a gnome from his store backroom. The dealer asks the goblin what he knows, but the goblin refuses, until the dealer brings out a dark chain and chokes him. The goblin tells us the puppetless string will lead them to salvation, that they have joined them and will kill us all. Learn they are organising goblin, hobgoblins and orcs to eliminate what we consider society. 

The dealer says that we can find more info at an outskirt town, but asks why would he tell us that, refusing when Tarlo says ‘because the eye wants you to’. The Dealer accepts after Gilbert offers to roll the dice again, getting 4 (1-3), bringing him down to 1hp and causing him to bleed from all his pores until we staunch his bleeding. The dealer tells us we can find more info in a town to the east, called Grudo (grew-dough), made of what Tarlo would consider heretics
