##### On the road again

The party discusses what to do about Zora once we get back to Granth, asking Tarlo to put their eye symbol away in fear that Zora could be watching through it. As we approach the gates of Granth, Feinren stuffs one of the notes down his boot for safe keeping.

##### Granth

We enter the city, putting carrots at a stable before travelling around on foot. As we move through the city, we notice a high presence of religious, paladin-esq guards of the Eye, sporting chain armour made of linking eye symbols, forming a shimmering pattern of green and black. We notice that the guards seem to be looking for someone, and Tarlo notes that they are church guards, and its quite unusual for them to be patrolling the streets, especially in such high numbers. 

Tarlo leads the party to an 'old friend', being relatively guarded about revealing who they are.

##### Guard Barracks 

Tarlo leads us into the church heavy centre of town, before taking us down into the centre of a church guards barracks. As we enter, all the guards hand slowly shift to their weapons, before a tall, variant human with darkish skin and slighlty more intricate armour, bursts into the room, coming from an office in the corner. He warmly welcomes Tarlo, before quickly ushering the group into his office, as everyone else gives us dirty looks. 

He introduces himself as Akarda, Tarlo's mentor, and questions Tarlo on whats going on, explaining that Zora has given an order for us all to be captured, expressing his surprise that we made it this far. We explain what we've been doing, and Akarda notes that he hasn't heard of the puppetless string, before explaining that Zora has become completely unhinged, while Rowan does nothing. Feinren shows Akarda the note, putting the note detailing Tarlo and the plans to kill the party on top, and tells him that Zora is likely controlling Rowan. 

Akarda says we need to fix this, and tells us that Zora was asking for us to be taken to the catacombs beneath her mansion, and then laughs at us when we call the dealer a potential ally (which Gabriel agrees with), but agrees that telling Adrik wouldnt be a bad idea, but also that his position hasnt held much power in recent years.
Need to separate Zora and Rowan, get Rowan from out from under her control. We realise that there is a small chance Zora has been looking through the eyes of Akarda's armour, before he takes us out of the barracks under the guise of us being his prisoners, before freeing us once we leave the church district. On request Feinren conjures a web around Akarda to make it look like we broke free ourselves, before the party leaves him to head to the Dealer. 

Feinren casts detect magic, and notices that both eyes in the notebook are now glowing, and that the armour the church guards wear shine like beacons.

##### Dealer's Store

Just before detect magic ends, Feinren notices huge array of glow coming from the items in the store. 

We tell the dealer about Zora, who says that he has known Zora to be a liar for long time (since he's met her). When shown the notes and told about Zora controlling Rowan, the dealer admits that he has seen her do it before, although he didnt know she was doing it to Rowan, before advising us to break Rowan out from Zoras control, as Rowan's word is law in Granth. 

The Dealer advises us that we could break Zora's control either by killing her, or showing Rowan the notes, but that the latter would be harder. He tells us that the catacombs where Zora does the majority of her work is the catacombs beneath her mansion, which has a hidden entrance at the base of the mountain which Zora's mansion sits on, however this entrance will still be guarded. The Dealer then says that our time is up, as 4 church soldiers barge down the stairwell, as the Dealer warns us not to break the store.

Gilbert tell the dealer he better help us if he doesnt want Gilbert to start using items from his shop, which the Dealer responds to by bringing us all into his arena.

##### Dealer Arena

The guards try to chant a spell, however the spell fizzles out as they finish chanting.  Gilbert threatens the guards, "You have two options, either you fail to capture us, or you fail to capture us and your family never sees you again". After some conversation, two of the guards walk away, disappearing after walking away from the centre of the Arena for a bit, while the two other guards begin to attack. Tarlo knocks one out but kills them after disastrously trying to stop their bleeding, while Gilbert kills the other, transforming him into his breastplate, with all the eyes becoming images of the guard praying on his knees.

Gabriel and the Dealer both compliment Gilbert for the masterful killing
