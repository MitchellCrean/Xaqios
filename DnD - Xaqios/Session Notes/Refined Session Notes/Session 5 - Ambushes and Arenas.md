—---- Dealer's Store ------------------------- 

Rahkoriin asks about the sickles, which the [[Dealer]] says he will sell for 50 gold if Rahkoriin proves himself worthy, before bringing out a deck of cards. The dealer is interested that Rahkoriin is a ‘man of blood’ as Rahkoriin draws a 4 of clubs. When he does this, the dealer tells him to hold the sickles properly, before black tentacles shoot across the floor, covering it as we all find ourselves in a black, void like dimension, with everyone but Rahkoriin and the dealer on the outside of a 30ft arena.

—---- Dealer’s Arena —-----------------------

The dealer pulls a dryad out of the void, who refuses to fight (“Please don’t make me do it again”) until the dealer brings out his inky chains. As Rahkoriin and the dryad fight, and Feinren checks that he still can access his familiars pocket dimension, the dealer appears behind Tarlo and asks her how strong she thinks her god is; T - “Stronger than yours”, D - “Perhaps, but I could be more helpful’, and the dealer reappears in the arena. The dryad briefly entangles Rahkoriin in roots before he kills her, but as her head falls to the ground it is caught by the void tentacles, and brought back to her shoulders, where it is reattached and she is revived by the dealer. 

—---- Dealers Store —----------------------

The void arena disappears, and the group finds themself back in the shop. Gilbert asks the dealer how best to annoy Gabriel, “From my experience just be yourself, if that fails pull some spiral shenanigans” (paraphrased). Gabriel - “Please, as if I could be annoyed, I am annoyance”

Feinren asks the dealer If he has any diamonds, and the dealer is curious as to what Feinren is using it for before selling it to him. As Feinren and the dealer are talking, he says “If you ever need help, I’lll be watching you”. Rahkoriin buys the sickles and the dealer tells him he is more than welcome to come again, before telling Tarlo “Before you take any more rites with the eye, remember that I am more powerful … can offer more help”

The group leaves the store and Tarlo guides them to a cheap pub/tavern in Granth.

—---- Tavern —-------------------

The group buy rooms from the snarky barkeep, with Rahkoriin sleeping on the ground, and Feinren, Gilbert and Tarlo sleeping in beds for 5 gold, after Tarlo fails to bargain. As Gilbert begins to fall asleep and Gabriel stops annoying him, Gabriel says he needs help falling asleep and asks Gilbert for help, to which he refuses.

As Tarlo guides us away from the tavern the following morning, a group of kids throw stones at Rahkoriin, running off after he extends his sickles and a guard begins chasing the kids.

—---- Gnome Depot —--------------

At a general store in Granth, Gnome Depot, the party sees the same Goblin that was in the dealers backroom, who is named [[Doublelock]]. He tries to scam Gilbert, but feels guilty as he does so. When asked about health potions he says he can sell them for 30gp, or we can get them from the dealer directly, but at a different cost, which he doesn’t like to pay often. When asked why he was at the dealer yesterday and why he had been brought out, he said he had been a bit prickish to the dealer, and that some deals are not meant to be good for you. Gilbert accepts 3 gold for the necklace he liberated from the dead noble from the camp (while knowing it was worth 4), and the dealer profusely thanks him. The party notices eyes all around the store, except for the backroom, where Gilbert buys some thieves' tools. Tarlo buys everyone a healer's kit, and Rahkoriin buys three more, asking Doublelock about armour, who recommends he goes to Vistra to get more quality armour than he has access to. As we leave we get the feeling that Doublelock doesn’t nice customers very often, seeing this, Tarlo refers him to the church support group for misguided souls, but he's already in it.

—--- On the road —----------------

Gilbert buys a horse and names it carrots, while the rest of the party gets a cart. Once the cart has gotten a fair distance from Granth, Feinren uses detect magic and notices the eye he drew before no longer has a divination aura around it, for later testing he draws a second eye in the notebook. 

As we are travelling, we are suddenly ambushed, two javelins thudding into carrots. Two orcs and an orc war chief, which Rahkoriin notices are wearing symbols of the hunt, appear from the forest and combat begins. Rahkoriin kills an orc on the right, while Feinren and Tarlo kill the one on the left, with the orc war-chief still standing, surrounded by the party.
